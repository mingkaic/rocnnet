tenncor:
- add optimization option to merge unary nodes
- add optimization option to merge n-nary nodes
- matrix multiplication on for n-dimension tensors only operate on first 2 dimension
- transpose should generalize to permute on n-dimensions
- remove move and clone functions for classes that don't need it
- define alloc shape as mutable and allowed shape as immutable (enforce this rule)
	placeholder of (4, 0) should accept input of size of any multiple of 4
- refine shape flexibility e.g: (4,) == (4,1)
	also any shape padded by 0 or 1 maybe “optimized” for lower dimensional shape
	(this should be an option, since some applications may not want to lose this information)
- improve tests
- possible dangling pointers by propagating destruction in the graph
- interface confusion:
    graphs have 2 methods of getting backprop node (get_leaf and get_gradient)
    users only have 1 valid method of getting backprop (get_gradient)
    currently, users can call get_leaf. change visibility

evaluate rocnnet principles:
- practicality
- efficiency
– logical correctness
- testability/program transparency

interesting ideas:
- scalable batch size (increasing batch size over generations)

tests:
- copying and moving observers on multiple unmanaged constants
- detaching unmanaged constants from observers
- copying immutable of uninitialized variables
