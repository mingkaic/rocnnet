#### How to Test

Test each module by behavior specified in 'behavior.txt'

#### Test Quality

Test quality is defined by the code coverage.

In terms of test coverage, we will favor fuzz testing over manual test cases 
(due to the random nature of neural nets which is our target domain).

#### Requirements

Code Coverage: (not fulfilled)

- Function coverage: 100%
- Branch coverage: minimum 80%
