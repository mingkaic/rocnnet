#### How to Test

Test each module by behavior specified in 'behavior.txt'

#### Test Quality

Test quality is defined by the code coverage.

Fuzz testing is a technique used to discover errors by inputting massive amounts of random data in attempt to crash the system.
For now the quantity of data is controlled by the number of test iterations.

#### Requirements

Code Coverage:

- Function coverage: minimum 90%
- Branch coverage: minimum 80%
- Statement coverage: minimum 80%
