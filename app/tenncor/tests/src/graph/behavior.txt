// REACTIVE BEHAVIOR
A000 - copying subjects do not copy over audiences
		moving subjects move over audiences and (UNTESTED) audiences have their dependencies reattached to new subject
		subjects without audience will return false if it has no observers
A001 - subjects notify all observers
		if UNSUBSCRIBE is called, then observer will suicide via death_on_broken
		if UPDATE is called, then observer will update via
		public update with subject being its input
A002 - destroying a subject will destroy their observers via UNSUBSCRIBE update,
		and via death_on_broken
A003 - attaching observer to subject at index means notifying the
		observer's protected update is triggered with calling subject and the index specified
		attaching does nothing to update observer's dependency (not tested)
A004 - detaching observer with index mean the above behavior will not hold for the specific index
		detaching observer without index will prevent above behavior from holding
		for any specific index to observer
		detaching does nothing to update observer's dependency (not tested)
A005 - constructing observer with dependencies should automatically attach
		constructed observer to designated subjects
A006 - copying/moving observers copy/move over dependencies
A007 - add_dependency with observer attaches observer to subject with index = dependencies_.size()
		additionally, push subject back to dependencies
A008 - remove_dependency with observer detaches observer from subject at specified index
		dependency at index is set to nullptr. trim all nullptrs from end of dependencies
		removing out of index throws exception
A009 - replace_dependency at index detaches the last subject at index, attaches new subject at index
		and replace subject in dependencies at index
A010 - destroying an observer will detach the observer from its subjects via a detach call

// NODE BEHAVIOR
B000 - cloning inode creates another node of the same label, but different uid,
		moving prevents coping over uid
B001 - a uid is unique for every instance of node
B002 - label is a non-unique string assigned during construction,
		name is the concatenation of uid and label

// LEAF BEHAVIOR
C000 - leaves clone and move copies and moves over its initialization status and data tensor
C001 - leaf get_shape returns the shape specified at construction
C002 - leaf get_eval returns a tensor of the shape specified at construction,
		the tensor's initialization status is uncertain
C003 - leaf good_status is good if the tensor is initialized, otherwise bad
(UNTESTED) C004 - reading a valid tensor_proto should initialize the leaf
C005 - get_leaves adds returns a set containing itself

// CONSTANT BEHAVIOR
D000 - constant scalar constructor initializes data as a scalar of the same value
		vector initializes tensor in vector form according to input data,
		the tensor has shape specified in constructor
		if the input vector does not match shape, clip data or pad data to fit
D001 - constant clone and move are deleted, clone and move return nullptr
D002 - constant derive returns 0 scalar node
D003 - constant get_gradient returns 0 scalar node
D004 - constant self destructs when it loses all its subscribers if is_managed flag is off
		otherwise constant wouldnt self destruct
D005 - constant tensors are always allocated

// IVARIABLE BEHAVIOR
E000 - ivariable clone and move copy and move over initializer
E001 - ivariable can initialize when initializer is not null
E002 - ivariable derive returns 1 scalar node
		if input is this otherwise return 0 scalar

// VARIABLE BEHAVIOR
F000 - variable scalar constructor is initialized
		variable constructor with no initializer specifies null init
		otherwise initializer is clone of input initializer
F001 - variable clone and move clones and moves from ivariable
F002 - variable set_initializer deletes its existing initializer
		and clones new init from input
F003 - variable get_gradient returns 1 scalar node if input leaf is this,
		otherwise return 0 scalar node
F004 - variable initialize notifies on success.
		variable initialization succeeds when initializer is not null,
		the existing tensorshape is well defined,
		or input shape is well defined and is compatible with tensor shape

// PLACEHOLDER BEHAVIOR
G000 - placeholder specifying shape has non-null initialization,
		but has un-initialized status (is_init_)
G001 - placeholder clone and move clones and moves from ivariable
G002 - placeholder assigning raw data initializes tensor and notifies observers
G003 - placeholder assigning tensor moves input tensor to inner tensor
G004 - placeholder get_gradient returns 0 scalar node

// CONNECTOR BEHAVIOR
H000 - copying connector copies over graph id, connector dependency (conform to definition of same graph),
		moving moves over graph id regardless, moving g_man_ will nullptr the original g_man_ pointer,
		(UNTESTED) connector copies over jacobians
H001 - connector name is the name of the connecting node in <> braces and
		its dependencies' labels separated by commas in () brackets
H002 - connector is the same graph as another connector if they share a common connector
		along its dependency graph.
H003 - connector potential descendent calls both this and other connnector get_leaves to get leaf set

// IMMUTABLE BEHAVIOR
I000 - cloning and moving immutable copies and moves over data, Nf_, (UNTESTED) ginit_, and gcache
I001 - immutable A is a potential descendent of connector B if A's leaf set is a subset of B's leaf set
I002 - immutable has good status if all its children are good, otherwise it's bad
I003 - immutable tensor shape is the result of the shaper function.
		bad status returns an undefined tensorshape
I004 - immutable tensor initializes its tensor from the forward transfer functions if all its arguments are good
		otherwise good status is false, bad status returns nullptr on get_eval
I005 - immutable dies when any of its dependencies dies
I006 - temporary_eval grabs the resulting node from target node up to calling node.
		the target node's value is taken as scalar 1.
I007 - immutable get_leaves return a map from leaf to nullptr
I008 - given an input of leaf A, get_gradient returns the node mapped by A in
		back_map (provided during construction). leaf A is back_map's second argument.
I009 - derive calculates gradient node from any node and applies jacobian transformation appropriately
		if wrt is this, return (without jacobian) is scalar 1 node,
		else if wrt is not a leaf but is a potential descendent, return temporary_eval from wrt to this
		else if wrt is not a leaf and isn't a potential descendent, return scalar 0 node
		otherwise the base result is the non-null node mapped from gcache
I010 - update explicitly runs its forward transfer function with current depdendency states as its argument
I011 - immutable will throw error if existing output shape is incompatible with shaper result

// GENERATOR BEHAVIORS
J000 - cloning and moving generators copies and moves initialization and existing data
J001 - generated shape has same shape as shape_dependent node
J002 - temporary_eval always returns 1, and derive is treated as constant (0 if leaf not this, 1 otherwise)
