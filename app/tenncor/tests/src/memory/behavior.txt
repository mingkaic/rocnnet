// ALLOCATOR
A000 - default allocator clone and move copies content of child instances
		(UNTESTED)
		tracked allocator clone ...
A001 - default allocator allocates bytes by num_elements * sizeof(type)
A002 - default allocator deallocates the continguous region regardless of the specified memory size
A003 - default allocators that do not track will throw when requested size,
		return false for tracks_size, and undefined optional for alloc_id
(UNTESTED, UNIMPLEMENTED)
A004 - tracked allocator keeps track of the memory size, 
		deallocate poisoned region will throw otherwise rely on address santizer
		Tracking allows a number of elements to be deallocated,
		otherwise deallocate the continguous region
A005 - tracked allocator return the allocated size, return true, and alloc_id

// ALLOCATOR BUILDER
B000 - alloc_builder is a singleton: only a single instance is accessible across threads
B001 - registering multiple instances of the same type of allocator is allowed
		registering a pre-existing identifier will return false
		registering a non-allocator will fail at compile time (untestable?)
B002 - getting an allocator that doesn't exist will return nullptr,
		otherwise return that alloc's registry instance
B003 - checking for a type of allocator with a particular identifier will fail if the instance
		at identifier isn't of that type or no instance is found at identifier. otherwise succeed
