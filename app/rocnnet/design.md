## ROCNNet
### Summary
Reactive-oriented Convolutional Neural Network (ROCNNet) is an implementation of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf) 
built on top of Tenncor library, a differentation library designed to minimize repeated operations.
