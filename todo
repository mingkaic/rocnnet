>>>>>>> long term goal >>>>>>>
   - develop and train model to recognize images, and commentate on the image in some way
      the idea is for the model to:
      - build internal representations of objects and physical and metaphysical properties in the image
      - relate those representations to natural language and build a human-understandable description

>>>>>>> inprogress >>>>>>>
   - train cnn on cifar using training harness
   - upgrade layr to allow restructuring recurrent structure sequence length
   - improve grader/optimization rule according to rnn, lstm, gru
   - implement and verify correctness of deep speech finetuning layers
